# nl-to-sql
NL to SQL converts natural language queries into SQL queries using NLP. This project aims to simplify database interaction for non-SQL users. NLP libraries and algorithms process and interpret natural language input, perform stopword removal, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging, and generate SQL queries for a database.Â
